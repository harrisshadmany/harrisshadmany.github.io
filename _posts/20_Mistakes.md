# 20 Mistakes I Made During my Quant Finance Internship (and How to Fix Them)

For the past 6 weeks, I've had the pleasure of interning at [D.E. Shaw](https://www.deshaw.com/who-we-are) as a Proprietary Trading intern. It's been a period of incredible personal growth and I've learned a lot from all the mistakes I've made.

I'm usually not a fan of "advice-giving" because it's ofentimes just a reflection of someone's biases and personal experiences. That's why every piece of advice I give in this post is motivated by a specific mistake I've made (with a description of what the failure mode looks like). At the very least, I hope you can avoid the errors of my ways :). 

**Tip #1: Ask good questions.** 

Whether it's a meeting with your manager, coffee chat with a team member, or intern learning event, this is the single most important concept I wish I had internalized before I started my internship.

**The quality of your interactions and the thoughtfulness behind people's answers is directly proportional to the time and energy you spent researching to prepare good questions.** Don't expect your coworkers to do your work for you - they need inspiration from good questions so that the really valuable stuff comes out. 

During one of my coffee chats with a team member, we were discussing a financial statement & balance sheet a company had put out. I spent 30 minutes beforehand preparing specific and well thought-out questions and I couldn't believe how great of a conversation we had. I had learned things I could never find online or on my own.

By preparing good questions, you focus the conversation on what you want to learn. That results in better engagement from both sides. It also reflects well on you: it shows you know what's important and you're willing to put in the effort to learn from someone. 

**Here's the mistake I made.** Even when you're not the person who schedules the chat, you should be prepared to help drive the conversation. When you have feedback sessions with your manager or short meetings, they may not have thought through exactly what you need to get "unstuck" on your project. If you haven't  thought about what would be helpful to get you unstuck, they probably haven't either.


**Tip #2: Ask "dumb" questions.** 

It's important to ask good questions. It's also important to ask low-level, seemingly trivial questions that you may have. If you're on a trading team, maybe you need help with some quirky aspect of the Bloomberg terminal. Or if you're on the software development team, you can't seem to wrap your head around how a few lines of code work. 

Whatever it is, **create a support system of people to help you navigate these situations**. Oftentimes, your manager may not be the right person for these types of questions. You shouldn't be afraid to ask if you need something, but maybe check in with a fellow intern or team member first who might have navigated a similar question.

**Here's the mistake I made.** It's easy to get intimidated by your brilliant co-workers. But everybody needs help and everybody has dumb questions. Confusion compounds: if you don't ask your dumb questions almost immediately, you'll soon have a list of 20 or 30. Not only will you be *much* slower to ramp up and be productive, you won't have learned as much as if you had just asked. **Be brave and ask.**

**Tip #3: Take the time to do things right.** 

Most of the projects you will be assigned are meaty, multi-week endeavors. It's almost never the right move to just jump in and start hacking together something to prove that you can be productive. 

For the vast majority of cases, you won't have the background knowledge in place to apriori design a well-thought out plan of attack. First, make sure you really understand the task you've been assigned. Clarify the details and slack your manager questions after the introductory meeting. If you're working on a project that involves some specialized financial product, you probably want to learn the basics first. How do you trade it? What's liquidity like? Who are the major players in that market? 

It can seem like you're making slow progress at first, but setting a solid foundation gives you the confidence to move quickly once you do begin the nitty-gritty work of the project.

**Here's the mistake I made.** As soon as I was given my project, I immediately created a dataset and fitted some models to present to my manager. But I lacked both the statistics background and domain knowledge required to make a meaningful contribution. I ended up having to spend the next week solidifying my background knowledge anyways.

**Tip #4: Be flexible with your schedule.** 

This is highly dependent on your employer: different workplaces have different expectations. At D.E. Shaw, however, no one expects you to work a strict set of hours. You have certain obligations, like attending meetings and responding to messages, but there's a lot of flexibility. You should take advantage of that. 

It's an open question as to what is takes to be productive. But it would be na√Øve to expect that somehow every day without fail, you'll show up to the office and get 8 magical hours of quality working hours in. It just doesn't work like that. You have to be cognizant of your energy levels and your mental health so that you can effectively manage your deadlines and work.

If you know you'll be exhausted Monday morning after a busy weekend, maybe you can schedule less cognitively intensive tasks like doing coffee chats or 


**Tip #5: Use version control.** 

This is not something that only applies to people writing code or building models. No matter what your role is, you should always save previous drafts of your work. First, something can always go wrong. What happens if you delete half of your document and accidentally hit the save button in Microsoft Word? Or if you deleted a paragraph from your first draft, but now you realize you want it back? 

**Every time you've finished a "draft" of a document, duplicate it and save it in a folder of older versions.** You don't have to get fancy, saving older copies locally in a folder is fine or maybe consider OneDrive or GitHub if that floats your boat.

**Here's the mistake I made.** Once I had retrieved my data, I would begin to clean it and remove any anomalies. I should've saved a copy of the original first. Sometimes, I would delete a column when I wasn't using that variable anymore. Then I'd decide I actually needed it. Again, I should've saved a copy.

**Tip #6: Avoid silent failures by using common sense.** 

This is sort of a niche tip that mostly applies to when you're modelling
