# 10 Mistakes I Made During My Quant Finance Internship (and How to Fix Them)

For the past 6 weeks, I've had the pleasure of interning at [D.E. Shaw](https://www.deshaw.com/who-we-are) as a Proprietary Trading intern. It's been a period of incredible personal growth and I wanted to share a few tips that I found helpful. 

This post originally started as a journal entry of all the mistakes I made and what I was going to do to fix them. Because of that, every tip is accompanied by a description of the mistake that resulted in it, and how to avoid the errors of my ways :). 

## Tip #1: Ask good questions.

Whether it's a meeting with your manager, coffee chat with a team member, or intern learning event, this is the single most important concept I wish I had internalized before I started my internship.

**The quality of your interactions and the thoughtfulness behind people's answers is directly proportional to the time and energy you spent researching to prepare good questions.** Don't expect your coworkers to do your work for you - they need inspiration from good questions so that the really valuable stuff comes out. 

During one of my coffee chats with a team member, we were discussing a financial statement & balance sheet a company had put out. I spent 30 minutes beforehand preparing specific and well thought-out questions and I couldn't believe how great of a conversation we had. I had learned things I could never find online or on my own.

By preparing good questions, you focus the conversation on what you want to learn. That results in better engagement from both sides. It also reflects well on you: it shows you know what's important and you're willing to put in the effort to learn from someone. 

**Here's the mistake I made.** When I first started going to meetings scheduled by other people, I wasn't prepared to help drive the conversation. I had to learn to prepare no matter what. If I was stuck on something, I would think about what might be helpful to get me unstuck.

## Tip #2: Ask "dumb" questions.

It's important to ask good questions. It's also important to ask low-level, seemingly trivial questions that you may have. If you're on a trading team, maybe you need help with some quirky aspect of the Bloomberg terminal. Or if you're on the software development team, you can't seem to wrap your head around how a few lines of code work. 

Whatever it is, **create a support system of people to help you navigate these situations**. Oftentimes, your manager may not be the right person for these types of questions. You shouldn't be afraid to ask if you need something, but maybe check in with a fellow intern or team member first who might have navigated a similar question. Everybody needs help and everybody has dumb questions. Confusion compounds: if you don't aggressively ask your dumb questions, you'll soon have a list of 20 or 30.

**Here's the mistake I made.** I was too afraid of asking dumb questions in front of my brilliant co-workers. As soon as I started being proactive about getting my dumb questions answered, I understood a lot more and ramping up was easier.

## Tip #3: Take good notes (and reflect on them).

One of your goals during the internship should be to learn as much as you can. In order to do this, you can't just passively absorb information and hope you remember. The first step in learning something is to have a good record of what you were being taught. This means you have to be proactive about taking detailed notes when someone says something useful.

The second part of learning is piecing together the details to actually *understand* the larger picture. This requires reflection: you're not going to know how your team thinks about a market after the first morning call. You might not even know after the next 30 morning calls unless you take good notes and re-read/synthesize the little details from each of the calls.

**Here's the mistake I made.** At first, I didn't take notes during morning calls. Soon, I realized I was not only zoning out, I couldn't articulate if I was learning anything. After I started a fresh journal entry for each call, I began to internalize how people liked to give their updates and other crucial information.

## Tip #4: Design with the end user in mind.

A lot of projects start somewhat ambiguously and you have to make design decisions to define what the end product might be. If you're a trading intern building a model, who's going to be using it? And how? If you're in business development brainstorming new strategies, who are you presenting to? Is your end product a PowerPoint? A written report? Do you get to choose?

No matter what your task is, you will have to make design decisions. **Design with the end user in mind at at all stages of your work**. I'll give you a concrete example. For my weekly meetings with my manager, we would often be discussing Python code or modelling details. It's hard to communicate technical details, especially virtually. So I would take screenshots of the important things, and throw together a quick PowerPoint.

Thinking backwards was always a helpful thought experiment for me. I would write down what I wanted the PowerPoint slides for our next update meeting to be before I even implemented anything, which helped guide me when there were multiple options at hand.

**Here's the mistake I made.** My first attempt at my project, I built the wrong model. Most of the details were right, but I had assumed what time scale we should be forecasting on when the needs of the team were different. 

## Tip #5: Communicate clearly (and be vulnerable).

While it's often hard to see its impact, good communication goes a long way. One of the biggest mistakes you can make as an intern is failing to communicative effectively. If you and your manager aren't on the same page, it's not going to work out well.

The issue here is not that people don't know this. The issue is that we are all human and honesty is difficult, especially when we're struggling with a task. This is yet another instance where you should **be brave**. 

**Here's the mistake I made.** For some reason, the last thing I wanted to do was admit to my manager that I was struggling with some aspect of my project or confused about the feedback I was being given. Being honest and having the tough conversations makes things a lot easier down the road. 

## Tip #6: Take the time to do things right.

Most of the projects you will be assigned are meaty, multi-week endeavors. It's almost never the right move to just jump in and start hacking together something to prove that you can be productive. 

For the vast majority of cases, you won't have the background knowledge in place to apriori design a well-thought out plan of attack. First, make sure you really understand the task you've been assigned. Clarify the details and slack your manager questions after the introductory meeting. If you're working on a project that involves some specialized financial product, you probably want to learn the basics first. How do you trade it? What's liquidity like? Who are the major players in that market? 

It can seem like you're making slow progress at first, but setting a solid foundation gives you the confidence to move quickly once you do begin the nitty-gritty work of the project.

**Here's the mistake I made.** As soon as I was given my project, I immediately created a dataset and fitted some models to present to my manager. But I lacked both the statistics background and domain knowledge required to make a meaningful contribution. I ended up having to spend the next week solidifying my background knowledge anyways.

## Tip #7: Manage your time well (and be flexible).

Your ability to do serious and meaningful work will vary drastically from day to day. Don't expect to show up every day and get 8 high quality thinking hours. Your energy levels, the amount of meetings in a day, and your deadlines will all have an impact on the amount you get done. 

Learn how to properly take breaks: walks, lunch with your fellow interns, and the gym are all good ideas.

If you know you'll be exhausted Monday morning after a busy weekend, maybe you should schedule less cognitively intensive tasks like doing coffee chats or responding to emails. Conversely, if by some miracle you have a meeting free day, that's a time to sit down with a demanding and high impact task and really make some progress.

**Here's the mistake I made.** After hours of straight coding to no avail, sometimes I would make little progress on a model. While exhausted, I would force myself to work more than 8 hours that day to attempt to make up the lost productivity. That only made the issue worse: 4 high-quality hours can do a lot more than 12 sleep deprived ones can. 

## Tip #8: Rigorously justify your work.

It's easy to get lost in the tedious details of whatever your project is. Sometimes you'll be so excited that you *can* access the data you wanted or implement the feature you designed that you won't ask *why* you did something in the first place.

**Everything you produce should be justifiable.** When you present your work or write code, you should be able to stand behind it and explain your reasoningly clearly. If you can't explain the "why" clearly and succintly, you're probably doing something wrong.

Sometimes computers get in the way of this. You may consider powering off the laptop to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and a pen to think for a while. 

**Here's the mistake I made.** For one of my models, I was so focused on increasing its predictive power that I added all the data I could get my hands on. Little did I realize that I couldn't actually explain why we should include some data or why we should try to forecast it. Sometimes, a little common sense can save you and your co-workers a lot of time.

## Tip #9: Avoid tunnel vision.

When you're working on a project or just ramping up, it's easy to suffer from tunnel vision. You're hyperfocused on what the next move is to make progress on your project and it dominates your day. To some degree, this is good. High quality work demands focus.

But good internships are about balance. If you're missing all the events or not getting time to do coffee chats, you're not getting broad enough exposure to the firm. Internships are a two way street: you should be evaluating the people you work with, the type of work you're doing, and deciding if this is something you'd actually like to do for your career.

**Here's the mistake I made.** Because I was so focused on doing high-quality project work, I almost forgot to think about what actually matters. I wasn't thinking about the type of people I wanted to spend my day around and what values were important to me. 

## Tip #10: Use version control.

This is not something that only applies to people writing code or building models. No matter what your role is, you should always save previous drafts of your work. First, something can always go wrong. What happens if you delete half of your document and accidentally hit the save button in Microsoft Word? Or if you deleted a paragraph from your first draft, but now you realize you want it back? 

**Every time you've finished a "draft" of a document, duplicate it and save it in a folder of older versions.** You don't have to get fancy, saving older copies locally in a folder is fine or maybe consider OneDrive or GitHub if that floats your boat.

**Here's the mistake I made.** Once I had retrieved my data, I would begin to clean it and remove any anomalies. I should've saved a copy of the original first. Sometimes, I would delete a column when I wasn't using that variable anymore. Then I'd decide I actually needed it. Again, I should've saved a copy.
