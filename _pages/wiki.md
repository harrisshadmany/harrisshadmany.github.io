Here are some of my posts organized by subject matter. I hope you find something interesting :). 

**Programming with Python Seminar** <br> Every month, I teach a seminar called "Programming with Python" for high school students through [Wave Learning Festival](https://www.wavelf.org), a fantastic organization started by [Karly Hou](https://www.karlyhou.com). It's a lot of fun and I post my lecture notes here so the students can review it afterwards.

Lecture 1: [Course Philosophy, Variables, Types, Input/Output](https://harrisshadmany.github.io/2021/07/24/Lecture_One.html) <br> 
Lecture 2: [If-Else Statments, For/While Loops, and Lists](https://harrisshadmany.github.io/2020/07/25/Lecture_Two.html)
