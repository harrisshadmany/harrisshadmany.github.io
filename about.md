# About

Hi there! My name's Harris Shadmany and I'm an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science major at Berkeley. I started this blog because I believe that blogging is a great way to review what I've learned recently (and to keep track of anything I may have forgotten).

If you want to get in touch, I can be reached at harrisshadmany@berkeley.edu.
